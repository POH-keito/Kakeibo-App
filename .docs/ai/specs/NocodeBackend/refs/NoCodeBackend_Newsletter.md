## サポートとのメールやり取り

### 1. ユーザーからのフィードバック（2025 年 8 月 2 日 19:52）

**送信者:** K Fukushima <fk.falt@gmail.com>  
**件名:** Feedback and Suggestions for Nocodebackend - A New Tier 5 User!

Hello Nocodebackend Team,

I recently purchased the **Tier 5 plan** because I find your platform incredibly interesting and believe it has overwhelming potential for the future. I'm very excited to be on board and look forward to working with your product!

I'd like to offer some feedback on a specific feature, as well as share my enthusiasm for the platform.

---

#### **Urgent Suggestion: Database Deletion Safeguards**

My main concern is with the **database deletion process**. Currently, a single click on the delete button instantly removes data. This feels quite risky, as a misclick could lead to accidental and irreversible data loss. 😥

To prevent this, I strongly suggest implementing more robust safety measures. At a minimum, a **two-step confirmation** (e.g., a confirmation pop-up asking "Are you sure?") should be required. For an even higher level of security, I would recommend a "type-to-confirm" feature, where the user must type a specific word, like "**delete**," into a text field before the deletion is executed. This would make it virtually impossible to delete critical data by accident.

---

#### **My Use Case & Positive Feedback**

I'm currently using Google AI Studio for "Vibe Coding," and I see a fantastic opportunity to use Nocodebackend as an external database. This setup will allow me to significantly **reduce long-term costs** and focus purely on front-end development, which is a huge advantage.

I have very high expectations for your platform and am genuinely excited about its future. Keep up the amazing work!

Best regards,
A very enthusiastic new user.

**送信者:** K Fukushima <fk.falt@gmail.com>

Hi Baalam,

Thanks for the reply! That's great news, I'm happy to hear it.

Another idea I had: maybe you could also consider an option to restore deleted items for a few days. That could be another good solution.

But I'll leave the details to you professionals! Thanks again.

Best,
Keito

### 4. ユーザーからの質問（2025 年 8 月 3 日 0:23）

**送信者:** K Fukushima <fk.falt@gmail.com>

Hi Baalam,

Thanks for your consideration on the deletion feature.

Actually, I have a follow-up question because I've already accidentally deleted one instance.

**Instance:** 52811_KakeiboAppDB

I tried to create a new one with the exact same name, but it seems I couldn't, so I created 52811_KakeiboAppDBv2 for now.

For my future reference, I'd appreciate it if you could clarify a couple of things:

1. If the instance wasn't physically deleted, is there any way to restore it?
2. I understand that instance names must be unique. When would the original name (52811_KakeiboAppDB) become available again? Or is that name now permanently unusable?

I believe that understanding the specifics of the tool is crucial for long-term maintenance and operation, so I'd be grateful for your explanation.

On a side note, the auto-generated documentation on Swagger Hub is incredibly helpful! Authentication is often a stumbling block with new tools, but thanks to your docs, the process was seamless for me.

I'm having a lot of fun playing with your platform and it feels like the future. It's a truly great service, thank you. I plan to write a detailed review once I've fully built out my tool.

Best regards,
Keito

Hi Keito,

I'll check on why you can't use 52811_KakeiboAppDB again if you already deleted it.

Let me check and get back to you.

Thanks

**送信者:** K Fukushima <fk.falt@gmail.com>

Hi Baalam,

Wow, thank you for the super quick response!

I tried creating it again. To save my AI tokens, I did it manually and accidentally created kakeiboappdb instead of KakeiboAppDB, haha.

Oh well, it works! I'm just happy to know that the old name could be released. That alone is great news.

I'll continue testing things out. Thanks so much for your help!

Best,
Keito

---

Hey 👋

Great news! You can now filter records directly in NoCodeBackend using query parameters on your API calls. Quickly narrow results by date ranges, partial text matches, numeric comparisons, and operators like GTE / LTE / NE / IN / LIKE — all via simple HTTP GET query strings (works with curl, Postman, or your app).

Click below to watch the demo:

- [YouTube 動画: Filter API results with query parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsLeqKCuc8s)

### Why you'll love it

- **Faster data retrieval**: Only get the records you need.
- **Flexible filters**: Combine multiple params (e.g., `manufactureDate[GTE]=2024-01-01&name[LIKE]=asp`) for precise queries.
- **Easy to test**: Try filters in Postman or curl before adding them to your code.

As always, we are here to help you out with any questions you may have.

Regards

### 重要なポイント

- **新機能**: クエリパラメータによるフィルタリング機能
- **対応オペレーター**: GTE / LTE / NE / IN / LIKE
- **フィルタリング可能な項目**: 日付範囲、部分テキストマッチ、数値比較
- **使用例**: `manufactureDate[GTE]=2024-01-01&name[LIKE]=asp` のように複数のパラメータを組み合わせ可能
- **テスト方法**: curl、Postman、またはアプリから直接テスト可能
- **デモ動画**: [YouTube 動画](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsLeqKCuc8s)

### 動画の詳細解説

**動画タイトル:** How to Use Advanced Query Filters in NoCodeBackend  
**チャンネル名:** NoCodeBackend  
**公開日:** 2025-08-10

#### 概要

この動画では、API リクエストのクエリパラメータを使用して、データベースから特定の条件に合うレコードをフィルタリングする方法（高度な検索機能）を紹介しています。主に「日付範囲」「部分一致（LIKE）」「特定の値（IN）」「大小比較」の使い方を実演しています。

#### 利用可能な演算子（オペレーター）

- `neq` (Not Equal To): 等しくない（例：ステータスが `inactive` 以外のものを取得）
- `gt` (Greater Than): より大きい（数値や日付に使用）
- `gte` (Greater Than or Equal To): 以上
- `lt` (Less Than): より小さい
- `lte` (Less Than or Equal To): 以下
- `in`: 指定した複数の値のいずれかに一致するもの
- `like`: ワイルドカード検索（部分一致）。特定の文字列を含むレコードを検索（例：名前に "John" を含むもの）

#### 実践デモの例

1. **特定の日付以降の検索**

   - **構文:** `manufactured_date[gte]=2025-08-01`
   - **結果:** 製造日が 8 月 1 日以降のレコードを取得

2. **日付範囲（Range）の検索**

   - **構文:** `manufactured_date[gte]=2025-03-01&manufactured_date[lte]=2025-08-10`
   - **結果:** 3 月 1 日から 8 月 10 日までの範囲内のレコードを取得
   - **注意:** 複数のクエリパラメータを `&` で繋げて指定

3. **部分一致検索（LIKE）**

   - **構文:** `painkillers[like]=cuff`
   - **結果:** 薬の名前に "cuff" という文字列を含むレコードを検索

4. **特定値の指定（IN）**

   - **構文:** `painkillers[in]=my med,gut boosters`
   - **結果:** 薬の名前が "my med" または "gut boosters" のいずれかであるレコードを検索
   - **注意:** 入力値は大文字小文字を区別しない（Case Insensitive）

#### デモ環境

- **データベース:** Pharmacy（薬局）
- **テーブル:** Medicines（医薬品）
- **データ項目:** 薬の名前、製造日、有効期限など
- **ヘルプテキスト機能:** API のエンドポイント画面に新しいヘルプテキストが追加され、各フィルターの意味と構文が説明されている

#### まとめ

これらのフィルターはアプリに組み込むことでシームレスに動作します。正しい構文に従うだけで、複雑な検索機能を簡単に実装できます。

## クエリフィルター機能の実装前後のメールやり取り

### 1. ユーザーからの機能リクエスト（2025 年 8 月 6 日 10:00）

**送信者:** K Fukushima <fk.falt@gmail.com>  
**件名:** Question Regarding Search Syntax for Auto-Generated APIs

Hello nocodebackend.com Support Team,

I am using your platform to generate APIs from my MySQL tables, and it's been a great experience so far. I have a question regarding the search query syntax for an endpoint your platform generated from my table.

I understand that for a new service, full documentation may still be in development. To make things easier for you, if your search syntax is based on a common standard, please feel free to just point me to that external documentation. A simple reference to follow is all I need.

I created a table named `transactions` with a structure like this:

```json
{
  "moneyforward_id": "string",
  "transaction_date": "2025-08-06",
  "content": "string",
  "amount": 0,
  "category_id": 0
}
```

Swagger is this: [API Documentation](https://api.nocodebackend.com/api-docs/?Instance=52811_KakeiboAppDBv2)

Here are my specific questions:

---

#### **Question 1: How to query a date range?**

I would like to search for transactions within a specific date range (e.g., from a start date `2024-03-01` to an end date `2024-05-21`) in a single request.

I tried using an array for the `transaction_date` field like this, but it returned an empty result even though I know records exist in that period.

```json
{
  "transaction_date": ["2024-03-26", "2024-03-27"]
}
```

Could you please show me the correct JSON format to specify a date range?

---

#### **Question 2: How to query for multiple values (OR condition)?**

Similarly, I would like to know how to search for records that match one of several possible values in a single field. For example, I want to find all transactions where `moneyforward_id` is either "foo" or "baa".

I tried the following structure but I am not sure if it's correct.

```json
{
  "moneyforward_id": ["foo", "baa"]
}
```

What is the correct way to structure this kind of "OR" query?

---

Thank you for your time and for pointing me in the right direction.

Best regards,

**送信者:** K Fukushima <fk.falt@gmail.com>

Hi Baalam,

Thank you so much for the incredibly fast response! I really appreciate it. You guys are awesome!

And yeah, I had a feeling that might be the case. I actually had an AI list all the "common syntaxes" for queries and tried every single one, but none of them worked, lol.

It's fantastic news that you've already created a ticket for this and that it will be implemented soon. I'll be eagerly awaiting that update! My current tier doesn't have a request limit, so I can make it work for now, but having this feature will really help streamline my logic and make things more efficient. Until then, I'll try to find a workaround using Joins and formulas, even if it's not the prettiest solution, haha.

On that note, I just have to say—I am seriously in love with your product. While it may have some rough edges, the core concept, user-friendliness, and simplicity are in a league of their own compared to other services like Supabase or Xano. The vision is just brilliant. I genuinely feel that from the bottom of my heart after using it.

My workflow involves using Google AI Studio to handle the front-end and processing logic, and your platform is the perfect backend to make it all happen. I provide a lot of Proofs of Concept for various clients, which means a constant cycle of building and tearing down projects, and your service is absolutely perfect for that.

Thank you for bringing this product into the world. For me, it's like a new pair of wings.

Best regards,

Keito

### 動画の詳細解説

**動画タイトル:** How to create APIs without writing any code | Welcome to NoCodeBackend V2  
**チャンネル名:** NoCodeBackend  
**公開日:** 2025-09-11  
**動画 URL:** [YouTube 動画](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kcjQYwc2g0)

#### 概要

この動画は、**NoCodeBackend の V2（バージョン 2）**のリリースを紹介する詳細なウォークスルーです。UI/UX の刷新、新機能の追加、および AI 機能の強化について解説されています。

#### 1. UI/UX の刷新とデータベース作成の改善 [[00:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kcjQYwc2g0&t=0)]

- **新しい UI:** プラットフォーム全体が刷新され、よりスムーズで高速、かつプロフェッショナルな UI になりました。
- **マルチテーブル作成:** 以前のバージョンではデータベース作成時に 1 つのテーブルしか作成できませんでしたが、現在は一度に複数のテーブルとカラムを追加できるようになりました。
- **デモ:** 「11th September」という名前のデータベースを作成し、以下の 2 つのテーブルを同時に定義しました。
  - **Users テーブル:** `Name`, `Email` (Varchar 型), `Password` (新機能)
  - **Books テーブル:** `Book Name`, `Price` (Int 型)

#### 2. 新機能：Password 型カラム [[02:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kcjQYwc2g0&t=156)]

- **暗号化機能:** 新しく追加された「Password」型のカラムを選択すると、入力された値はバックエンドで自動的に bcrypt アルゴリズムを使用してハッシュ化（暗号化）されます。
- **セキュリティ:** API を通じてデータを取得（Read）しても、実際のパスワード文字列は公開されず、ハッシュ化された値が表示されます。これにより、ユーザーのパスワードや機密情報（OTP、シークレットトークンなど）を安全に管理できます。

#### 3. API の自動生成とテスト [[03:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kcjQYwc2g0&t=226)]

- **即時生成:** データベースを作成すると、クリック一つで全ての API エンドポイント（GET, POST, PUT, DELETE）と API ドキュメント（Swagger UI）が自動生成されます。
- **テスト実行:**
  - 自動生成されたドキュメント上で、Secret Key を使って認証。
  - **Books:** 「Harry Potter」などの本を追加し、cURL コマンドが生成されることを確認。このコマンドをフロントエンド（React, Webflow など）に組み込むだけで実装が完了します。
  - **Users:** ユーザーを作成し、Password フィールドがレスポンス上で暗号化されて表示されることを確認しました。

#### 4. JOIN（テーブル結合）機能の強化 [[12:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kcjQYwc2g0&t=727)]

- **目的:** 複数のテーブル（例：Books と Users）を結合して、一つのビューとしてデータを取得したい場合に使用します。
- **作成方法:** 以下の 3 つの方法が提供されています。
  1. UI を使った直感的な作成
  2. SQL クエリを直接記述
  3. **AI による作成:** 自然言語で「Books と Users を結合して、ID、本、ユーザー名、メールを取得して」と指示するだけで JOIN を作成できます。
- **デモ:** Books テーブルと Users テーブルを AI を使って結合。最初は ID が一致せずデータが出ませんでしたが、整合する ID を持つデータを追加することで、結合されたデータ（本とユーザー情報がセットになったデータ）が正しく取得できることを実証しました。

#### 5. その他の管理機能とプラン [[19:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kcjQYwc2g0&t=1141)]

- **チーム機能:** ユーザーを招待して共同作業が可能。招待されたユーザーが作成したデータベースも管理画面から確認できます。
- **カスタムドメイン:** API ドキュメントを自社のドメイン（例: <https://api.yourdomain.com>）で公開する機能（プランによる）。
- **クレジットシステム:** データベース数や AI エージェント呼び出し（Agentic Calls）のためのクレジットを追加購入可能。現在は買い切り型ですが、将来的には月額サブスクリプションへの移行が予定されています。

#### 6. AI Agentic Calls（AI エージェント呼び出し） [[21:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kcjQYwc2g0&t=1308)]

- **高度な AI 生成:** 単なるテキスト生成ではなく、データベース作成、テーブル設計、カラム設定、API 生成、ドキュメント作成といった複数のタスクを裏側で連携して実行するため、「Agentic Call」と呼ばれています。
- **デモ:** 「映画（Movies）データベースを作って。ハリウッドとボリウッドのテーブルがあり、映画名、公開日、ジャンル（ドロップダウン：アクション、SF、ロマンス）を持つ」という曖昧な自然言語プロンプトから、完璧なスキーマと API を一発で生成しました。

Hey 👋

We just shipped a new tutorial that pairs Greta (UI) with NoCodeBackend (database + APIs) to build a Book Listing Marketplace—no code. The secret sauce is our Swagger (OpenAPI) JSON: export the full API schema once, paste it into Greta, and your UI instantly understands every endpoint, parameter, and auth step. Then bind live data for add/edit/delete, search, and sort—production‑ready, fast.

Watch the video below:

Prefer another UI builder? Use the same Swagger spec—Greta is just the example.

**チャンネル名:** NoCodeBackend  
**公開日:** 2025-09-15  
**動画 URL:** [YouTube 動画](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIKqAZjLYJI)

#### 概要

この動画では、バックエンド構築ツールの「NoCodeBackend」と、フロントエンド生成 AI ツールの「Greta」を連携させ、データベースと連携した Web アプリを短時間で構築するプロセスを実演しています。

#### 1. データベースの作成（NoCodeBackend 側）

- **プロジェクト開始:** NoCodeBackend を使用して、「BookDB」という名前のデータベースを作成
- **テーブル設計:** 以下のフィールドを持つテーブルを定義
  - `Book Name` (書籍名)
  - `Author` (著者名)
  - `Price` (価格 - Integer 型)
  - `Image` (画像 URL - Varchar 型)
- **自動 API 生成:** データベースが作成されると、即座に API エンドポイントも自動生成

#### 2. API のテストと Swagger JSON の取得

- **API テスト:** 生成された API ドキュメント画面で、Secret Key を使って認証し、手動でテストデータを 1 件作成
- **重要な機能「Swagger JSON」:**
  - NoCodeBackend の新しい機能として、**Swagger JSON (OpenAPI Specification)** をワンクリックで取得可能
  - すべての API エンドポイント、メソッド、パラメータ、構造が含まれている
  - **メリット:** この JSON をコピーして、Greta、Cursor、Lovable などの AI コーディングツールに渡すだけで、ツール側が API の仕様を完全に理解できる

#### 3. フロントエンドの生成（Greta 側）

- **Greta への指示:** NoCodeBackend からコピーした Swagger JSON を Greta に貼り付け、「Book Listing App（書籍リストアプリ）」を作成するようプロンプトを入力
- **初期生成:** UI が生成されるが、最初は Greta が用意したダミーデータが表示
- **API 連携の指示:**
  - 実際の API データを使用するように指示
  - **認証設定:** Secret Key を Authorization ヘッダー（Bearer Token）として使用（デモのため直接キーを渡しているが、本番環境では環境変数を使うべき）

#### 4. 動作確認と機能修正

- **連携成功:** アプリが更新され、NoCodeBackend 側で作成したテストデータが表示。エラーなしで一発で連携に成功
- **新規作成機能:** アプリ上から新しい本（ハリー・ポッター）を追加すると、プレビューが表示され、作成ボタンで正しく保存
- **編集・削除機能の修正:** 最初は「編集」と「削除」ボタンが機能していなかったため、Greta に「機能するように修正して」と指示
- **再テスト:**
  - **編集:** タイトルを「Harry Potter Book」、価格を 499 に変更 → 正常に更新反映
  - **削除:** 削除ボタンをクリック → レコードが消え、データベースからも実際に削除されたことを確認

#### 5. まとめと感想

- データベースと完全に統合された、永続的なフルスタックアプリケーションが完成
- **驚きの結果:** 通常、AI コーディングツール（Lovable や Cursor など）を使うと、何度かやり取りが必要になることが多いが、今回は Swagger JSON を渡したおかげで、ほぼ一発（One-shot）でエラーなく動作するアプリが完成
- NoCodeBackend の Swagger JSON 出力機能が、AI ツールとの連携において非常に強力であることを強調

  - サインアップには `POST` エンドポイント（ユーザー作成）を使用すること
  - サインイン（ログイン）には `GET` エンドポイントを使用し、クエリパラメータでメールとパスワードの一致を確認して認証すること

#### 4. 認証機能のテストと検証

- **ログインテスト:**
  - 登録したユーザー（James）で正しいパスワードを入力 → ログイン成功
  - 誤ったパスワード → ログイン失敗（認証されない）
  - 誤ったメールアドレス → ログイン失敗
  - Greta 側で基本的なバリデーションも実装されていることを確認
- **新規登録テスト:** 新しいユーザー（Balum）を作成し、パスワード確認（確認用入力との一致）機能も Greta が自動で実装していることを確認

#### 5. データベース側での制約強化（ユニーク制約）

- **課題:** 同じメールアドレスで複数のアカウントが作成できてしまう問題が発生
- **解決策:** NoCodeBackend 側で「Email」カラムを**ユニーク（Unique）**に設定し直す
  - 既存の Email カラムを削除し、AI に「常にユニークな Email カラムを作成して」と指示して再作成
- **再テスト:** 既に存在するメールアドレスでサインアップしようとすると、「Email already exist（メールは既に存在します）」というエラーが表示され、重複登録が防げるようになった

#### 6. 今後の展望とまとめ

- **残された課題:**
  - パスワードのリセット機能（次回解説予定）
  - パスワードを忘れた場合のメール送信機能（複雑だが今後解説予定）
- **完成した機能:** ユーザー管理システムのコア部分（登録、ログイン、重複防止）が完成し、不正アクセスを防ぐ準備が整った

**送信日時:** 2025 年 9 月 29 日(月) 19:45  
**件名:** Introducing Scoped Secret Keys in NoCodeBackend 🔑

---

Hey 👋

We're excited to announce our newest feature: Scoped Secret Keys.

Now, instead of relying on a single all‑powerful key, you can create multiple keys, each with its own defined scope:

- **🔍 Read** – access data safely without changes
- **✍️ Write** – add new entries only
- **♻️ Update** – make modifications to existing records
- **❌ Delete** – remove data entries with care
- **🌐 All** – full‑access when needed

### With scoped keys, you get

- Greater control over how frontends, services, and collaborators interact with your database.
- Reduced risk: limit exposure by sharing only what's necessary.
- Flexibility: multiple keys for different environments, teams, or partners.

👉 You can start generating scoped keys today—just head to your project dashboard, open Secret Keys, and choose the permission scope you want.

This means you'll always grant the right level of access—no more, no less.

Smarter access. Safer workflows. More control.
That's Scoped Secret Keys.

Keep building the future,

Team NoCodeBackend

### 重要なポイント

- **新機能**: スコープ付きシークレットキー
- **利用可能なスコープ**:
  - Read（読み取り専用）
  - Write（新規作成のみ）
  - Update（更新のみ）
  - Delete（削除のみ）
  - All（フルアクセス）
- **メリット**:
  - フロントエンド、サービス、コラボレーターとのデータベース連携をより細かく制御
  - リスクの低減：必要な権限のみを共有
  - 柔軟性：異なる環境、チーム、パートナー向けに複数のキーを作成可能
- **使用方法**: プロジェクトダッシュボード → Secret Keys → 希望する権限スコープを選択

**公開日:** 2025-09-27  
**動画 URL:** [YouTube 動画](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKQvkNz6DQk)

#### 概要

この動画では、従来は非常に複雑だった「パスワードを忘れた場合のメール送信」や「パスワードリセット処理（トークン生成など）」を、NoCodeBackend の新機能を使って簡単に実装する方法を紹介しています。

#### 1. 導入と背景

- **従来の課題:** ユーザー認証システム（登録・ログイン）は比較的簡単に作れるが、「パスワードを忘れた場合の処理」は、SMTP サーバーとの連携、JWT トークンの生成、有効期限管理などが必要で、実装が非常に面倒
- **NoCodeBackend の新機能:** これらがネイティブでサポートされ、バックエンドコードを書くことなく、生成された API エンドポイント（cURL コマンド）を使うだけで実装可能に

#### 2. データベースと SMTP の準備（NoCodeBackend 側）

- **データベース作成:** 「Users Auth DB」を作成し、「Users」テーブルを用意
  - カラム: `Name`, `Email`, `Password` (Password 型を選択すると自動で bcrypt ハッシュ化)
- **SMTP 設定:** データベース一覧のメニューから「SMTP」を選択し、メール送信に使用する SMTP サーバーの情報を登録（必須ステップ）

#### 3. フロントエンドの生成（Greta 側）

- **Swagger JSON の取得:** NoCodeBackend から Swagger JSON を取得し、Greta に渡す
- **指示内容:**
  - ユーザー管理システム（登録・ログインフォーム）を作成
  - 「パスワードを忘れた（Forgot Password）」ページと、「パスワードリセット（Reset Password）」ページも作成
  - **重要:** パスワードリセットのロジックは Greta 側で勝手に作らせず、NoCodeBackend が生成するコードを使うため、「ロジックは追加しないで」と伝える
- **ログイン修正:** Greta への追加指示として、ログインには GET エンドポイントとクエリパラメータを使用し、メールとパスワードを照合するよう具体的に指示。また、Authorization ヘッダー（Secret Key）の使用も伝える

#### 4. パスワードリセット機能の実装

- **コード生成:** NoCodeBackend のテーブル編集画面に新設された「Forgot Password Code」ボタンをクリック
- **設定項目:**
  - 認証に使用するテーブル（Users）とフィールド（Email, Password）を選択
  - **リセットページの URL:** フロントエンド（Greta で生成されたアプリ）のパスワードリセットページの URL を指定
  - アプリ名とロゴ URL を入力
- **生成されるコード:** 2 種類の cURL コマンドが生成される
  1. **メール送信コード:** パスワードリセットメール（トークン付きリンク）を送信するため
  2. **パスワード更新コード:** 新しいパスワードをバックエンドに保存するため

#### 5. Greta への統合と動作確認

- **メール送信の実装:** 1 つ目のコードを Greta に渡し、「Forgot Password」ページの「リンクを送信」ボタンに紐付けるよう指示
- **メール受信確認:** 実際にリセットリンクをリクエストすると、設定したロゴとアプリ名が入ったメールが届く。リンクにはセキュリティトークン（15 分間有効）が含まれている
- **パスワード更新の実装:** 2 つ目のコードを Greta に渡し、「Reset Password」ページの「パスワードをリセット」ボタンに紐付ける
- **最終テスト:** メール内のリンクからリセットページを開き、新しいパスワードを設定。その後、古いパスワードではログインできず、新しいパスワードでログインできることを確認

#### 6. まとめ

この機能により、複雑なバックエンド構築やトークン管理をすることなく、SMTP 設定と生成されたコードのコピペだけで、セキュアなパスワードリセットフローが実装可能になった

Hi,

Stop writing code for database calculations. Traditionally, creating a field like a 'discounted price' would mean writing backend logic or complex database triggers. We believe there's a better way.

Our new video shows the power of NoCodeBackend's AI in action. Watch as we create a discounted_price column that auto-calculates its value—all from a single, plain-English sentence.

It's more than just a cool feature; it's a fundamental shift in how you can build and manage your backend.

Since you're seeing the power firsthand, we wanted to let you know that our Lifetime Deal is currently available. It's an opportunity to own this new way of building, with access to all current and future AI capabilities, for a single one-time price.

Cheers,

The Team at NoCodeBackend

### 動画の詳細解説

**動画タイトル:** NoCodeBackend AI in Action: Building an Automated Database Column  
**チャンネル名:** NoCodeBackend  
**公開日:** 2025-10-29  
**動画 URL:** [YouTube 動画](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lTCB87pHVw)

#### 概要

この動画では、複雑な SQL やコードを書くことなく、**AI に話しかける（自然言語を入力する）だけ**でデータベースに計算機能付きのカラムを追加し、自動的に値を計算させる方法を実演しています。

#### 1. 導入と目的の設定

- **シナリオ:** E コマース用のデータベースにある「Products（商品）」テーブルを使用。商品の「Price（価格）」カラムが既に存在
- **課題:** 全商品に対して 50%オフのプロモーション価格を設定したい。通常、この計算を行うにはアプリケーション側でコードを書くか、データベース側で複雑なトリガー（Trigger）を設定する必要がある
- **解決策:** データベース自体に自動で計算させる。「Products」テーブルに新しいカラムを作成し、そこに元の価格の 50%の値を自動的に計算して表示させる

#### 2. AI による自動計算カラムの作成

- **操作手順:** AI インターフェースに移動し、以下の指示を自然な英語で入力
  - _"Create a calculated column in the products table named discounted price which calculates 50% of the value in the price column"_
  - （日本語訳：Products テーブルに『discounted price（割引価格）』という名前の計算カラムを作成し、Price カラムの値の 50%を計算するように設定して）
- **実行結果:** 指示を送ると即座に処理が完了。「Discounted Price」カラムが追加され、AI が自動的に通貨扱いに適した「Decimal（小数）」型を選択して設定

#### 3. API を使った動作検証

- **テスト手順:**
  1. シークレットキーを入力して認証
  2. 新しい商品のデータを定義：
     - 商品 ID と名前を入力
     - **価格 (Price):** `900` に設定
     - **割引価格 (Discounted Price):** **ここには値を入力せず空欄のままにする**（自動計算されることを確認するため）
  3. `Execute` をクリックしてレコードを作成
- **確認:** 全レコードを取得して確認すると、新しく作成された商品のデータは以下のようになっていた
  - **Price:** 900
  - **Discounted Price:** **450** （900 の 50%が自動的に計算され保存されている）
- これにより、計算のためのコードを 1 行も書かずに目的が達成されたことが証明された

#### 4. 今後の展望とまとめ

- 今回紹介したのは機能のほんの一部
- **応用可能性:** 退屈なタスクや複雑なロジックも、欲しいものを言葉で説明するだけで解決可能
- **その他の機能:** 計算カラムだけでなく、テーブル間の複雑なリレーション（関係性）の管理、外部キー（Foreign Keys）の作成、その他の制約（Constraints）の適用なども、AI とチャットするだけで実行可能
- これがデータとの付き合い方を変える「ゲームチェンジャー」であると強調

---

### 重要なポイント

- **新機能**: AI によるデータベース計算機能
- **従来の課題**: 計算フィールド（例: 割引価格）を作成するには、バックエンドロジックや複雑なデータベーストリガーが必要だった
- **NoCodeBackend の解決策**: 自然言語の一文から、自動計算されるカラムを作成可能
- **例**: `discounted_price` カラムを、単一の平易な英語の文から作成し、自動で値を計算
- **意義**: バックエンドの構築と管理方法の根本的な変化

## Meet Domain Whitelisting: Lock Your Secret Keys to Your Domains

**送信者:** NoCodeBackend  
**送信日時:** 2025 年 11 月 3 日(月) 1:21  
**件名:** Meet Domain Whitelisting: Lock Your Secret Keys to Your Domains

---

Hi,

Big security upgrade: Domain Whitelisting is now live. This adds a powerful protection layer on top of scoped Secret Keys—so even if a key is exposed, it can't be used from unapproved domains.

### What this means for you

- **Zero trust by domain:** Your Secret Keys only work from the domains you approve.
- **Defense-in-depth:** Combines with scoped keys to limit both what a key can do and where it can be used.
- **Breach containment:** A leaked key becomes useless outside your domain footprint.
- **Wildcard power:** Use patterns like `.example.com` to cover all subdomains.
- **No breaking changes:** If you don't add domains, keys keep working as they do today.

### How to turn it on (30 seconds)

1. My databases → ⋯ → Secret keys
2. In "Allowed domains," type a domain and press comma/Enter to add chips
3. Click Save

### Why it matters

Prevents unauthorized access: Stops abuse from unfamiliar hosts and hostile environments.

### 重要なポイント

- **新機能**: ドメインホワイトリスト機能がリリース
- **セキュリティ強化**: スコープ付きシークレットキーの上に追加の保護レイヤーを提供
- **主な機能**:
  - **ドメインベースのゼロトラスト:** 承認したドメインからのみシークレットキーが機能
  - **多層防御:** スコープ付きキーと組み合わせて、キーができることと使用場所の両方を制限
  - **侵害の封じ込め:** 漏洩したキーも、承認されたドメイン外では無効
  - **ワイルドカード対応:** `.example.com` のようなパターンで全サブドメインをカバー
  - **後方互換性:** ドメインを追加しなくても、既存のキーは従来通り動作
- **設定方法**: My databases → ⋯ → Secret keys → "Allowed domains"にドメインを入力 → Save
- **実装状況**: 2025 年 10 月 31 日の質問で「実装検討中」と回答されていたが、11 月 3 日に実装された
